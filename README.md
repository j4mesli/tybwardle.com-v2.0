# tybwardle.com v2.0
A Wordle-style game refreshed daily made with N.A.P.E (Node.js, Angular, PostgreSQL, Express) and TypeScript, where the player guesses a randomly selected BLEACH character. Come play *tybwardle* at <a href="">https://tybwardle.com</a>!

Using  N.A.P.E (Node.js, Angular, PostgreSQL, Express) and TypeScript, I created a game inspired by the New York Times' Wordle game that allows for players to guess a new random character, updated daily! External images sourced from the <a href="https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki">official BLEACH wiki</a> and an <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">external style sheet</a> were used for the creation of this game!

## TO-DO:
1. Allow for users to view their past games and statistics with a guess-rate aggregation from the PostgreSQL database!
