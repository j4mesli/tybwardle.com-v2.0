        <p><em>THOUSAND YEAR BLOOD WARDLE</em> is a game based off the New York Times' Wordle minigame where you take turns guessing what a hidden word is!</p>
        <p>To play, you enter a guess into the text bar, and submit it! The game will then tell you whether your answer is <span style="color: #32cd32">CORRECT</span> or <span style="color: #cc3300">INCORRECT</span>, and if incorrect, will highlight the mismatching information provided <span style="color: #cc3300">RED</span>.</p>
        <p>The game will also indicate to you when your guess' measurements are wrong! A "üî∫" next to a guess' value means the answer's value is greater than the guess', a "üîª" indicates that the answer's is less, and a "‚ùå" means the value type is incorrect! (ex: if the answer doesn't have a provided height, the "‚ùå" will always be displayed, and vice versa!)</p>
